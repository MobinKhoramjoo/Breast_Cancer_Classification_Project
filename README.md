# Breast_Cancer_Classification_Project

Here in this project, we obtained microarray data (GSE45827) from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database to perform data analysis and develop a machine learning (ML) model
to classify the samples based on their gene expression.\
This dataset has the expression of 54675 genes from 151 tumor biopsies of patients with breast cancer. There are 5 different
subtypes of breast cancer in this dataset, including non-cancerous samples, the four classes of
breast cancer, and one breast cancer cell line isolated from breast cancer tumors which was used
in the reference study.\
After preprocessing the data, various linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques were tested.
Subsequent to evaluation of these methods on the data, we trained diverse ML classifiers using original features. Moreover, we conducted an applicational
evaluation on the classifiers. We could develop calssifiers with high classification metrics which all were tested for
overfitting by aseessing the metrics in both train and test set.
